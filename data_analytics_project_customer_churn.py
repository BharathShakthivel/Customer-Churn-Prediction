**Understanding business problem**

Why do customers Churn?

Customer churn happens for a variety of reasons, but the most common ones include:

1. **Poor Customer Experience**

  Bad service, long wait times, or unhelpful support can frustrate customers and push them toward competitors.

2. **Lack of Engagement**

  If customers don’t see the value in your product or service or forget about it, they may cancel or stop using it.

3. **High Prices or Better Offers Elsewhere**

  If competitors offer a better price, promotions, or superior value, customers may leave for a better deal.

4. **Unmet Expectations**

  If your product/service doesn’t deliver what was promised, customers will lose trust and leave.

5. **Poor Onboarding Process**

  If users don’t understand how to use your product effectively from the start, they may never fully adopt it.

6. **No Personalization or Customization**

  Customers expect businesses to cater to their needs. A one-size-fits-all approach can make them feel undervalued.

7. **Product or Market Fit Issues**

  If your solution doesn’t fully address a customer’s needs or if their needs change, they might look elsewhere.

8. **Technical Issues or Reliability Problems**

  Frequent downtime, slow performance, or buggy features can lead to frustration and abandonment.

9. **Lack of Loyalty Programs or Incentives**

  If there’s no reason for customers to stay, they’re more likely to switch to a competitor.

10. **Business or Personal Changes**

  Sometimes, churn is out of your control—customers might go out of business, change jobs, or experience financial difficulties.
